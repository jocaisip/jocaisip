Hi, I’m Jo! @jocaisip

I am a postgraduate student at George Brown College in Toronto, Canada, completing my program in Applied A.I. Solutions Development in the field of Analytics, Data Science, and Machine Learning. 

As an avid tech enthusiast, I'm always interested in the future of technology and I hope to help advance technolgies that can positively impact society and the environment. 
I’m currently learning concepts of Deep Learning and the applications of DL models, and I'm also learning visualization and analytics with Big Data. I like exploring new problems and solutions to continually apply and practice my knowledge and skills.
